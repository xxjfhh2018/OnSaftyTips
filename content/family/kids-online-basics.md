# Online Safety Basics for Kids

Start with short, clear rules that kids can remember and follow on their own.

## Family rules to agree on
- Ask a parent before downloading new apps or games.
- Do not share your real name, school, address, or daily routine online.
- Only chat or play with people you know in real life.

## Device setup
- Create kid-friendly accounts with screen time limits.
- Turn on safe search and app content filters.
- Keep devices updated and require a PIN or passcode.

## What to do when unsure
- Stop, screenshot, and tell an adult if something feels wrong.
- Block and report bullying or suspicious messages right away.
- Never send money or gift card codes to anyone online.
