# Internet Safety Tips for Teens

Internet Safety Tips for Teens focus on privacy, social media safety, and healthy online behavior. Teens live online for friends, school, and hobbies, so safety should feel like smart choices and open communication—not surveillance. Use these steps to stay in control of your accounts, your reputation, and your well-being.

## Why this is a risk

- Oversharing can expose location, routines, or private photos that get reshared without consent.
- Fake accounts and DMs can pressure you into sharing images, money, or personal info.
- Posts, comments, and tags build a lasting digital reputation that colleges or employers may see later.
- Location tags and live video can reveal where you are right now, increasing stalking or theft risks.
- Group chats can spread rumors or screenshots quickly; once sent, content can be hard to remove.

## What you should do

- Lock down profiles: set friends-only visibility, require tag approvals, and review app-level privacy settings monthly.
- Think before posting—ask, “Would I be okay with a teacher, future employer, or family member seeing this?”
- Use unique passwords and 2FA for all social and email accounts; never reuse one password across multiple apps.
- If something feels off (pressure to move to private chats, requests for photos or money), pause and talk to a trusted adult. Save screenshots before blocking/reporting.
- Turn off default location sharing for photos, stories, and live streams; add locations only after you leave a place.
- Curate followers: remove or restrict people you don’t recognize; review follower lists monthly.

## Build safer social profiles

- Enable login alerts and recovery emails/phone numbers you control.
- Review connected apps and revoke any you don’t use; old quiz or game apps can still read your data.
- Clean up your bio and pinned posts—keep them accurate and low on personal details.
- Use Close Friends/Lists for sensitive stories; avoid sharing IDs, tickets, or school schedules.
- Archive or delete old posts that no longer represent you or reveal past routines.

## Messaging and group chat hygiene

- Mute or leave chats that pressure you to share personal info or private images.
- Disable auto-save of media to your camera roll; it reduces accidental reshares.
- For new contacts, verify their identity through a known friend or video call before trusting links.
- Set clear boundaries: “I don’t share pictures like that,” or “I’ll ask my parent before clicking links.”
- If harassment starts, screenshot, block, and report; tell a trusted adult or counselor early.

## Gaming and community spaces

- Use gamer tags that don’t reveal your real name, school, or hometown.
- Keep voice chat to friends or trusted teams; avoid sharing personal details mid-game.
- Decline unsolicited file or mod downloads; use official stores and verified mod hubs.
- Set spending limits or require approval for in-game purchases; guard stored payment methods.
- Report bullying or hate speech; many platforms act faster when multiple reports arrive together.

## Plan your “trusted adult” checklist

- Pick two trusted adults you can contact if something feels off; save their numbers as favorites.
- Agree on how to share concerns—text first, then call, or show screenshots in person.
- If an incident happens, pause posting, gather evidence (screenshots, usernames, links), and block/report.
- Remind yourself: seeking help early is strength, not trouble; adults can escalate reports faster.

## Maintain your digital reputation

- Google your name and usernames monthly; remove old posts or request takedowns where possible.
- Audit tagged photos and set approvals; untag or remove anything misleading or too revealing.
- Keep school and personal profiles separate; use different usernames and privacy levels.
- Before applying to jobs or colleges, archive posts that show locations, routines, or inside jokes that can be misread.

## Common mistakes to avoid

- Accepting every follow or friend request; unknown followers can screenshot and reshare your posts.
- Using one password across all apps; a single breach exposes everything.
- Leaving location sharing on by default for photos or stories; post locations after you leave.
- Joining private calls or meetups with people you haven’t verified; always meet in public with a trusted adult aware.
- Sharing screens during calls without checking open tabs or notifications; sensitive info can leak.
