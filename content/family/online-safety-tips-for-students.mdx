# Online Safety Tips for Students

Online Safety Tips for Students focus on protecting school accounts, keeping research clean, and avoiding scams on shared networks. This guide gives clear steps you can apply today to keep coursework, personal data, and devices safe—without adding extra stress during busy semesters.

## Why this is a risk

- School accounts are frequent phishing targets; one click can expose grades, personal info, and financial aid details.
- Shared labs, library computers, or borrowed devices can auto-save logins and files if you forget to log out.
- Public or campus Wi-Fi can leak credentials if you join spoofed hotspots or skip HTTPS checks.
- Assignment files from classmates or unknown links can hide malware; a single risky download can lock you out during deadlines.
- Social pressure to join every group chat can lead to oversharing or clicking on “urgent” links without verifying.

## What you should do

- Use a password manager; keep school logins unique and enable 2FA if offered. Avoid reusing your school password on personal apps.
- Verify every school email: check sender domain, spelling, and whether the request makes sense. When unsure, open the school portal from your bookmark, not the email link.
- Log out and clear browser data on shared devices. Turn off “save password” prompts on lab computers and disable file sync for guest sessions.
- Download assignments and software only from official portals or app stores. Never install “free” PDF converters or random extensions to submit work.
- Keep browsers and OS updated. Accept updates before exams or big submissions to avoid forced restarts mid-test.
- Use campus VPN if available when on public Wi-Fi; at minimum, verify network names with campus IT and favor HTTPS sites.

<Info>When you’re rushed, default to opening the school portal from a bookmark rather than any emailed link.</Info>

## Quick security setup (10 minutes)

- Add 2FA to your school email, LMS, and cloud storage.
- Create a browser profile just for school with a clean bookmark bar (portal, library, citations, plagiarism checker).
- Turn on auto-lock for your laptop/phone after a short idle time; require a PIN/biometric.
- Remove unused extensions; keep only essentials (grammar checker, citation helper) from trusted sources.
- Set download prompts to “ask where to save” so you don’t run files blindly.

## Study and collaboration habits

- Use shared docs with restricted access (view/comment as needed). Remove access after group projects end.
- Name files clearly and store them in a dedicated school folder; avoid dumping them into “Downloads.”
- For group chats, set norms: no unknown links, no attachments from strangers, verify meeting links in the LMS.
- Keep a “clean device” policy for exams: close extra tabs, log out of personal accounts, and disable notifications.
- Back up important assignments to school cloud plus one personal drive; keep offline copies before big exams.

## Public Wi-Fi and travel checklist

- Confirm the network name with campus signage or staff; avoid look-alike SSIDs.
- Turn off auto-join for public networks; join manually when needed.
- Use VPN if available; otherwise, stick to HTTPS and avoid logging into banking or shopping on public Wi-Fi.
- Disable file sharing and AirDrop/Nearby Share in public spaces.
- Sign out of all accounts before closing the laptop in a café or library; power off if stepping away.
- After travel, change your main passwords (email, LMS, cloud) and review account activity.

## Exam day security routine

- Restart your laptop the night before to apply updates and clear temp files.
- Log in to required exam portals from bookmarks; test 2FA and camera/mic permissions.
- Remove unneeded extensions; some proctoring tools block exams if extensions are present.
- Close personal email, socials, and messaging apps to reduce distractions and accidental notifications.
- Plug in or fully charge devices; low battery prompts can break focus during timed tests.
- Keep a printed backup of exam access instructions in case Wi-Fi drops.

## Safe research habits

- Start from trusted sources: school library databases, known journals, or reputable news outlets.
- Check URLs before entering login info; look for HTTPS and the correct domain.
- Avoid copy-pasting commands or code from random forums without scanning for intent.
- If you need a new tool (citation manager, diagram app), get it from the official site or app store—never from ads.
- Keep notes of sources to avoid accidental plagiarism and to retrace if a link was malicious.

## Common mistakes to avoid

- Reusing your school password on personal apps—one breach can unlock all accounts.
- Leaving devices unlocked in libraries or cafés; auto-lock should trigger within minutes.
- Using personal email or random cloud drives for graded work; mixing contexts increases leak risk.
- Ignoring browser or OS updates; outdated software is easier to exploit and may block secure exam tools.
- Installing “helpful” extensions from ads or unknown developers; they can read pages and steal tokens.
- Forgetting to remove shared access after group projects; old links can be reshared without you knowing.

<Tip>Do a weekly 10-minute cleanup: clear history and downloads on shared devices, remove stale extensions, and rotate key passwords if you logged in on public Wi-Fi.</Tip>

## Summary

Protect logins with unique passwords and 2FA, verify links through bookmarks, and tidy your tracks on shared devices. Online Safety Tips for Students are about small daily habits—clean browser profiles, limited extensions, careful downloads, and clear group norms. These steps keep your coursework, identity, and devices safer every day, especially when deadlines are tight.
