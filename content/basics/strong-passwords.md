# Strong Password Basics

Keeping every account safe starts with passwords that attackers cannot guess.

## Core rules
- Use at least 12 characters and mix letters, numbers, and symbols.
- Avoid personal info like birthdays, names, or pet names.
- Never reuse the same password across different sites.

## How to manage them
- Turn on a password manager to generate and store unique logins.
- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) wherever possible.
- Update old or weak passwords during your next sign-in.
