Social media makes it easy to share moments from your life, but sharing too much personal information can put your safety at risk.  
Understanding **what not to post on social media** is one of the most important steps to protect your privacy online.

Below are **seven essential social media safety tips** everyone should follow.

## Why Social Media Privacy Matters

Many people underestimate how much personal information can be collected from social media posts.  
Even small details—when combined—can be used for stalking, scams, or identity theft.

Being mindful of your online behavior helps reduce these risks significantly.

---

## Don’t Post That You’re Home Alone

### Why sharing this information is dangerous

Posting that you’re home alone for long periods can make you an easy target.  
Even people you know—or think you know—could misuse this information.

**Tip:** Avoid real-time updates about your personal living situation.

---

## Don’t Share Your Home Address Online

### Protect your physical location

Revealing where you live can expose you to robbery, harassment, or physical harm.  
Once shared online, location information is difficult to control or remove.

**Tip:** Never post photos or messages that reveal your exact home address.

---

## Avoid Sharing Your Daily Routine

### How schedules can be used against you

Posting your daily habits—such as work hours, gym times, or regular hangouts—can allow someone to predict your movements.

**Tip:** Keep routines private and avoid location-based check-ins.

---

## Avoid Posting or Sending Sensitive Photos

### Private photos can become public

Even if you trust the person receiving a photo, accounts can be hacked and images can be leaked without your consent.

**Tip:** If you wouldn’t want it shared publicly, don’t send or post it online.

---

## Never Share Personal or Financial Information

### Information that should always stay private

Never share the following online:

- Passwords  
- Login credentials  
- Credit card numbers  
- One-time verification codes  

Sharing sensitive data—even through private messages—can lead to identity theft or financial loss.

---

## Use Social Media Privacy Settings

### Why public profiles increase risk

Public social media accounts allow anyone to view your posts, photos, and personal details.  
This makes it easier for scammers and criminals to collect information about you.

**Tip:** Regularly review and update your privacy settings.

---

## Don’t Share Travel Plans Before or During Your Trip

### Travel posts can alert criminals

Posting travel plans in advance lets others know you’re not at home.  
This information can be exploited for burglary or scams.

**Tip:** Share travel photos after you return safely.
