# Spotting Phishing Attempts

Most scams rely on urgency and fear. Slow down and look for the telltale signs.

## Red flags
- Messages that demand immediate action or payment.
- Links that look misspelled or point to odd domains.
- Requests for passwords, MFA codes, or banking details.

## Verify safely
- Contact the company using an official number, not the one in the message.
- Log in by typing the URL yourself instead of clicking embedded links.
- Compare the sender address with past legitimate emails.

## If you clicked
- Change passwords and enable MFA on the affected account.
- Run an antivirus scan and clear saved logins on the device.
- Report the scam to your email provider and, if money is involved, your bank.
