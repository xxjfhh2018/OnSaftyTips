# Safer Sharing on Social Media

Social feeds can reveal more than you expect. Trim exposure with these habits.

## Profile controls
- Set profiles to private where possible and review follower lists monthly.
- Hide contact details, location history, and birthday.
- Use separate emails for social accounts vs. banking or work.

## Posting checklist
- Avoid real-time location posts; share after you leave.
- Blur or crop documents, badges, or mail visible in photos.
- Skip quizzes or chain posts that ask for personal facts.

## Direct messages
- Verify unexpected requests—even from friends whose accounts might be hijacked.
- Decline links to downloads or giveaways that look suspicious.
- Report and block abusive accounts instead of engaging.
